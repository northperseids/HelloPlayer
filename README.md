# Hello Player

Small self-contained game written in PyGame and using PyGUI.

I wrote this months ago in order to learn Python and a bit of game design. It was my first full Python project, so it's probably not the most efficient and it's probably got some errors and/or newbie mistakes, which I *might* revisit at a future point, but that point is Not Now, so it's as-is.

Packaged using PyInstaller.

To play, download the .zip file, then for Windows, run "HelloPlayer_Win.exe". For Linux, run "HelloPlayer_Linux".
