She debates over some clothing for a little... and then she laughs and says it probably doesn't matter."

The voice wonders what they would look like in a dress.\n'Ada, you don't have any way to wear a dress,' Germain answers.\nI wonder why Ada can't wear a dress. Dresses sound nice."

She says something about googly eyes...? There's another voice that laughs and says they like them. Germain laughs, but she looks a bit sad and says 'At least we can still laugh at times like this.'\nI wonder what she means by that."

I can't believe he got the ingredients - it's not like we can pop off to a grocery this far underground.'\nThat seems unusual. They must be very far underground to not be able to go to a grocery. I wonder why they're there.\n...Happy birthday to Sophie, though! That must be nice."
