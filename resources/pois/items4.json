He mentions heading north and jokes about whether he should bring a coat, which another voice answers that he won't be outside much.\nHe looks a little somber at that.\nHe has packed some art supplies! I guess he's an artist."

A voice asks why he's doing that, and he answers 'It's always more comfortable to personalize a space, Ada. We'll be here for a while.'\nI wonder where they are. And I want to know who Ada is. They aren't on screen."

What can I do?' and he answers 'It's camaraderie, Ada. Tell me where to put them that you think the team will find it funny.'\nThat seems like a silly activity. I wonder why he's doing it.\nStill... it sounds amusing, doesn't it?"

Wouldn't he want to spend time with them?\nAnother voice tells him happy birthday.\nThere's a pause... then the other voice asks if they have a birthday, and he answers 'What's your creation date?'\n'April 19th.'\n'Sounds as good a birthday as any, doesn't it?'\nCreation date?

Bit of a break from the doom and gloom.'\nThe rest of the log is him drawing.\nWho is the woman?"
